## Duplicating a scenario

:::tip Available in Slovakia, Hungary
:::

:::caution
A scenario cannot be duplicated while the results are being calculated or when the calculation is (successfully) finished. The duplicate button is disabled then.
:::

Duplicating a scenario can be used to rapidly define a new scenario based on an existing scenario.

Go to the case detail page. A scenario can be duplicated hovering over the scenario name in the list at the left and clicking on the duplicate button. A pop-up appears asking the user to provide a name for the new scenario. The scenario names in a case should be unique, so an error message is shown when a name is provided that already exists.

After clicking on Save, the new scenario is added to the list of scenarios at the left.

Duplicating a scenario takes some time. During the duplication, an icon is shown to the right of the copied scenario and a message appears when hovering over the icon.

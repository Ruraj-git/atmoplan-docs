When a calculation is finished, an email is sent to the user. The results of the calculation can be inspected by clicking on 'View results' in the case overview, or in the case detail page (top right).

The results consist of:

- Interpolated maps containing the yearly mean concentrations for each pollutant
- Interpolated maps showing the absolute and relative difference for the yearly mean concentrations between the scenario and baseline scenario
- Time series for the POIs
- A zip file containing CSV result files

### Interpolated maps

Go to the results page of a case. The menu on the left shows all the scenarios of the case, all substances, the different map types, the POIs and a button to download the results.

For the baseline scenario, the annual mean concentrations for the four pollutants (NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, WILDCARD) can be selected.

For a non-baseline scenario, also the relative and absolute difference maps of the yearly mean concentration with respect to the base scenario are provided. In these maps, positive values refer to an increase in concentrations (worsening of the air quality), while negative values refer to a decrease in concentrations (improvement of the air quality).

When selecting a map in the drop down list, the map is visualized on the right, using a default legend which is shown in the bottom left corner. For each pollutant a default legend is provided (option 'default'), but it is also possible to select a legend ranging from the minimum to the maximum value on the map (option 'dynamic'), or to provide a custom minimum and maximum value (option 'custom').

![Result map for NO2: custom legend](./images/result_no2_custom.png)

### Timeseries for POIs

By default, the POIs of the case are shown on the map using blue markers. When the user clicks on a marker, a graph is displayed with the modelled concentration time series for each scenario.

The user can select the pollutant to be displayed in the graph and the temporal resolution (hourly or daily mean concentrations). By moving the mouse over the graph, the date and corresponding concentration values are displayed for each scenario.

Additional functionalities are available through the menu above the graph. These functionalities include:

- Downloading the graph as a PNG
- Zooming:

  - Select the zoom icon and draw a rectangle to zoom in on a specific part of the graph
  - Use + and - to zoom in and out
  - Use 'autoscale' to reset the graph after zooming

### Downloading the results

The results can be downloaded via the 'Download output' button. When the user clicks this button, a zip-archive will be downloaded containing the results for all scenarios in the case.

#### Case

At the highest level, the zip file contains one folder for each scenario. The folder name corresponds to the scenario name. The folder also contains the following files for the case:

##### Input:

| File/folder      | Content                                                      |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| case_summary.txt | Describes the general settings and grid settings of the case |
| poi.txt          | Name and location of all POIs of the case                    |

##### Output:

There are no output files for the case.

#### Scenario

Each scenario folder contains files that describe the scenario and result files:

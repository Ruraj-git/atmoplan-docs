title: User management
---

When a user has admin rights, the main page shows a fourth menu item: 'User management'. When clicking on this menu item, a table is shown with all current users.

The user admin can edit or delete users via the menu item at the right.

New users can be added via the '+' button. The user admin should specify the first name, last name, email and role of the new user. Currently, two roles are supported: expert and user admin. When clicking on save, an email is sent to the email address that was provided. Upon receiving this email, the new user can login to the ATMO-Plan tool using the link in the email. The new user can create a password by clicking on 'forgot password' in the login page.
